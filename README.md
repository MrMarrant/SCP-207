[h2]How does the effects occurs ?[/h2]

Well, once a player has drunk the entity, a cycle will begin, a cycle lasts 60s, there are a maximum of 48 cycles and from the 30th your chance of dying suddenly increases drastically, the 48th is the last no matter what.

Your running, walking and jumping stats increase with each cycle,
However, at certain cycles, events appear like the one where players can destroy doors or the overlay that appears with each cycle.

Be careful, however, as destroying doors can cause serious damage, and running at the high speed into certain entities can injure you.
